# contactMe
Why not have another random channel someone can reach out to me on?  Open a PR to drop me a message across all my channels at once.

# Purpose
Knowing which channel to communicate with someone on, what their contact info is, and even manning all of the potential channels is impossible today.  

From Microsoft Teams, Slack, Cisco Webex, Webex Teams, Google Meet, Email, SMS or iMessage, Jabber, Lync, Skype, GoToMeeting, Hangouts/Google Chat, Signal, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Zoom, Reddit, a private Discord server, Clubhouse, Racket, Facetime, Twitter, TikTok(?!), Instagram, AOL Instant Messenger, my pager, or snail mail.

So why not have another ridiculous option of opening a pull request on a repo?

Edit the contact_me.txt file directly in Github.  Submit a PR.  Maybe it will trigger a CI/CD action, maybe it will magically message all my channels, maybe it will go into a black hole.  Won't be a big difference from taking a shot in the dark across any of the other channels will it?  Or maybe it will be.

# Actual Future Potential
This silly idea was a passing joke, but I started to think, what if we created #messageOps that allowed a simple standard for submitting a message - a single entry or door, that could be publiclly shared that at a minimum, shared your preferred contact methods, and maybe even integrated to those.  We'll see where it goes from here :)
